## üì¶ Project Setup

#### Requirements

- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/): _v2.6.0_
- [Starknet Foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/index.html) _v0.26.0_

We recommend installing dependencies using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/):

```bash
asdf plugin add scarb
asdf install scarb 2.6.0
asdf plugin add starknet-foundry
asdf install starknet-foundry 0.26.0
```

#### Compile

To compile the project, run:

```bash
scarb build
```

#### Set you env

Follow the .env.template

```bash
source .env
```

#### Code Style

To format the code, run:

```bash
scarb fmt
```

#### Testing

To run tests (using Starknet-Foundry), use:

```bash
scarb test
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
scarb test <name_of_the_test>
```

#### Devnet

To generata an accound see :
[this page](https://docs.starknet.io/quick-start/set-up-an-account/)

```bash
cargo install starknet-devnet
```

To run a new node

```bash
starknet-devnet
```

Fork existing chain with flag

```bash
--fork-network $FORK_URL
```

for further options

```bash
starknet-devnet --help
```

#### Deploy

To deploy (on testnet/mainnet/devnet), use:
1. Check available contract

```bash
bash scripts/declare.sh
```

2 Declare contract -> it gives you a class_hash

```bash
bash scripts/declare.sh <contract_name>
```

3. Deploy contracts
If you want to simulate the whole infra, please deploy in this order: mock_stable, project, minter, offsetter

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_<name>.sh <ClASS_HASH> <...ARGS>
```


### Guidelines

- All tests should be placed in the `tests/` folder.
- Tests should be organized according to the tested file and function.
- Refer to existing tests for coding style and structure.
- Use utility functions from `tests/tests_lib.cairo` to set up your tests and avoid redundancy (especially `default_setup_and_deploy` and `buy_utils`).
